# Contact Sharing

Own contacts can be shared within a project with the other admins. This means that all admins can select the shared contacts within the project, for example when creating a crew member. 

Shared contacts can still be edited and deleted only by the owner.

To share a contact in the filmlet web app, click on `Shared Contact` in the Side Drawer. 
In the mobile app you have to click the last item in the bottom navigation bar and then on `Contact Sharing`.
