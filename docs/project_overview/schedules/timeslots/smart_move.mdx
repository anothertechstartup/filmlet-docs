# Smart Move

**Automatic route calculation to the last and new location**

By clicking the ** Calculate Route ** Button in the move element, a google maps route **between** the **previous** and the **target location** 
is getting **calculated**. 
You are asked if you want to apply the duration and route to the move element.

The calculated duration can be overwritten at any time, by using the duration field.
