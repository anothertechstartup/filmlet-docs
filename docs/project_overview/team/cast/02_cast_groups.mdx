# Cast Groups

Cast groups can be created to group cast members. In the cast overview, all members are also displayed according to the group.
To create or delete a group, you can click the button `Cast Groups` and a list of all groups will be shown. 

To assign a group to a cast, you can select a created group via the group picker on creation or in the detail screen.
