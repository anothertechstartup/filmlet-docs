# Sharing

:::danger NOTe
 Callsheets need to be [published](./publishing.mdx) in order to be visible to the people.
:::



## Cast & Crew

Call sheets are shared automatically with cast and crew, if the individual has a filmlet account. The callsheet can be viewed on the home screen in the callsheet list. 

Through cast & crew sharing, the calltime on the callsheet is automatically adjusted to the associated department.


## Share by URL

Create a file at `src/pages/my-markdown-page.md`:

Callsheets can be shared via the generated URL with people who do not have a filmlet account. In this case the callsheet is not personalized and does not contain any contact data.
